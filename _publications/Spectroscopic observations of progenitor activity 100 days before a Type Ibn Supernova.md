## Paper Summary

This paper presents photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2023fyq, a Type Ibn supernova in the Virgo cluster galaxy NGC 4388, and its progenitor activity detected by ZTF. For ~150 days prior to the terminal explosion, the progenitor exhibited an exponential rise in flux. Spectroscopic observations during this phase, beginning ~100 days before the explosion, revealed complex He I emission lines with P-Cygni profiles and broad wings, indicating unstable, violent mass loss from a He-rich star immediately preceding core collapse.

## Main Results

- **Progenitor Activity**: The progenitor's bolometric luminosity rose exponentially before the supernova, reaching a total radiated energy of \(L_{t < t_{\rm exp}} \approx 6.6 \times 10^{47}\) erg. The blackbody radius expanded linearly at \(\sim 200\) km s\(^{-1}\) to a peak of \(1.75 \times 10^{14}\) cm, suggesting a confined CSM or an inflated stellar envelope.
- **Spectral Evolution**: Pre-supernova spectra show complex He I 5876 P-Cygni profiles with absorption at \(1700\) km s\(^{-1}\) and broad emission wings extending to \(\sim 13,000\) km s\(^{-1}\). This is the first spectroscopic evidence of such pre-explosion activity for a Type Ibn event. The broad features are consistent with electron scattering in a dense CSM (\(\tau_e \approx 18\)).
- **Supernova Properties**: The supernova reached a peak r-band magnitude of \(-18.8\) mag (for a distance of 17.2 Mpc) and a peak bolometric luminosity of \(4.2 \times 10^{43}\) erg s\(^{-1}\). The total radiated energy of the supernova was \(6.0 \times 10^{49}\) erg. The estimated CSM mass involved in the interaction is \(\sim 0.05\,M_\odot\).
- **Confirmation of Core-Collapse**: Late-time spectra (>100 days post-explosion) show broad emission from O I, C I, and the Ca II triplet, confirming that SN 2023fyq was a genuine core-collapse supernova and not a non-terminal eruption.
