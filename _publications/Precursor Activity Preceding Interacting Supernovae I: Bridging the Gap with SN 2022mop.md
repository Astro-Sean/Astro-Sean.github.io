## Paper Summary

SN 2022mop exhibited a nebular-phase stripped-envelope supernova (SESN) in August 2022 (~200 days post-explosion, resembling Type Ib/IIb) in the outskirts of IC 1496 (luminosity distance \(7.07 \times 10^7\) parsecs). After fading, it rebrightened in August 2024 with a 4-month rise, peaking January 2025 (\(r = 16.40 \pm 0.02\) mag) as a hydrogen-rich interacting Type IIn SN. Pan-STARRS astrometry shows both events coincide within \(2.8 \pm 0.8\) parsecs (0.02 ± 0.25 pixels).

## Main Results

- **Nebular Modeling**: SUMO radiative transfer fits of August 2022 Keck/LRIS spectrum indicate a helium core progenitor with initial mass \(M_{\rm He,init} = 4.0\,M_\odot\), a core velocity of \(\sim 3.0 \times 10^3\) km s\(^{-1}\), and synthesized \(^{56}\)Ni mass of \(6.0 \times 10^{-2}\,M_\odot\), implying a zero age main sequence mass \(M_{\rm ZAMS} \leq 18\,M_\odot\) and a neutron star remnant .

- **2022 Light Curve**: The 2022 transient exhibited 1 magnitude outbursts occurring 215, 250, and 275 days post-explosion, showing ~27 day periodicity and inconsistent with a purely \(^{56}\)Ni-powered decline .

- **Merger-Burst Scenario**: The 2022 neutron star natal kick (\(\sim 3.0 \times 10^2\) km s\(^{-1}\)) likely produced an eccentric orbit interacting with its hydrogen-rich companion star's envelope, leading to repeated envelope collisions and subsequent heating. The 2024 transient is interpreted as an energetic Type IIn powered by the merger of the compact object with its companion star with estimated peak blackbody luminosity \(L_{\rm BB,peak} \approx 7.8 \times 10^{42}\) erg s\(^{-1}\) .
- **Host Environment**: H\(\alpha\) line luminosity corresponds to a star formation rate \(\sim 1.0 \times 10^{-4}\,M_\odot\) yr\(^{-1}\). The improbability of two unrelated transients coinciding so closely suggests both events arise from the same binary system .
