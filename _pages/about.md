## About Me

### Current Position
Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Munich  
Leading research on high-energy astrophysical transients using multi-wavelength photometry and X-ray observations.

### Research Focus
- Precursors and mass loss in massive stars before core-collapse supernovae  
- Combining photometric and spectroscopic analysis with numerical modeling and Bayesian methods

### Previous Experience
- Postdoctoral researcher at Oskar Klein Centre, Stockholm University  
- Specialized in spectral modeling and precision photometry of interacting transients and presupernova candidates  
- PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics from University College Dublin (2022) focusing on supernovae and impostors

### Collaborations & Expertise
- Active collaborator in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), LSST Transient and Variable Science group, and eROSITA consortium  
- Expertise in photometric pipeline development, radiative transfer simulations, and transient classification

### Research 
Driven to uncover the complex evolutionary pathways of massive stars leading to explosive phenomena.
